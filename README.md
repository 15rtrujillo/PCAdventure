-- GAME INSTRUCTIONS --
Objective: Find the trophy and place it on the pedestal in your home (yellow) castle to win!

* W, A, S, and D move your character (the square)
* R resets you back to the starting postion, but increments the Resets counter in the upper-left corner of the screen. You can also press the reset button in the upper-left corner of the screen.
* Space bar will drop your carried item. Carried items hover over your head.
* Escape either completely quits the game or takes you back to the main menu; I can't remember which.
* While holding the sword, you will kill anything you touch.
* While holding a key, touch the gate of the same-colored castle to open the gate.
* The yellow dragon will chase you and try to eat you if you get too close. If he eats you, you will have to reset to get out of his stomach.
* The bird can pick up anything, even dragons. He will eventually drop whatever he is holding, but he might drop it in an inconvenient location.
* Gary (the green dragon) is special.


-- GAME INFO --
This was the first Unity game I ever made.

This game is based of the Atari 2600 game, Adventure, released in 1979 or 1980 (Wikipedia isn't sure).

All the assets in this game were made by me using the original game as a reference.

The maze is static. One day I may make the maze random or add different levels with different mazes. The original game had configurable settings based on how you flipped the switches on the console, such as how many dragons would spawn and how many mazes you would have to go through to obtain all the items required to win. I may implement some of these things one day.
